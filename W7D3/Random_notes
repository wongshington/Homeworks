Overview of components hierarchy
  Root
    -responsible for connecting component tree with the store
    -renders giphysSearchContainer
  GiphysSearchContainer
    -container for GiphysSearch component
    GiphysSearch
      -renders search bar and handles all search logic
        -keeping track of quert abd trigger AJAx request on submit
      -renders Giphys Index
      GiphysIndex
        -iterates over giphys in props
          -renders a giphysIndexItem for each
       GiphysIndexItem

State Shape
  -because we want to display giphy results returned by AJAX
    -will need a slice of state that holds collection of giphy obs
      -> giphys: []
Reducers receive state and action as arguments
  -which as we know from just above, will be an array
RootReducer with Redux's combineReducers function
  -assigns control of different slices of state to respective reducers to create application state
????Will 'DOMContentLoaded' be provided on the assessment?
Each change in the app's state should come from action creator
Container components subscribe to the store, read state, and pass props while presentational components render the user interface.

how can we tell what is a presentational component vs container outside of it being labeled as container
